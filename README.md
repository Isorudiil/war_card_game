# War Card Game

## Plan:
    
### How does "War" work?
- Shuffle cards
- Divided deck evenly between the two players
- Each player places top card of divided deck face up
- Compare cards to see whose card is higher
- If tie, commence war:
  - Each player removes one card (it is held by 'dealer')
  - Each player places one card to see whose card is higher
  - Winner takes all six cards (initial tie, the removed cards, and the tiebreaker cards)
  - If tie again, commence war
  - Winner takes all ten cards
  - Continue until winner
- Game ends when one player has all cards

### How can I recreate "War" in code?
- Need to store the deck
  - Will this be a class? Or something else?
- Need to store the suits
  - Will this be a class? Will this be part of the deck?
- Need to create a place to hold cards in play
  - Maybe this will be a list?
- Need logic to handle which cards are "higher" and if there is a tie
  - This also needs to control if there are multiple ties, or any number of ties
- Need to check after every play whether either player has the entire deck

### Is there more..?
